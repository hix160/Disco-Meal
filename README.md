# Disco-Meal

**Discounted-Meal** *or* **Disco-Meal** is an open-source project designed to help users in Latvia access:
- **Discounted food prices** for the current day.
- **Meal recipes** based on the discounted food items.

The data is sourced from two major retail stores:
- **Maxima**
- **Rimi**

This project was initially created for personal use, and it serves as a way to showcase my skills and knowledge in building full-stack web applications.
